# Building a Modern Portfolio with Next.js 15

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to build a stunning portfolio website using the latest technologies including Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

## Why Next.js 15?

Next.js 15 brings several exciting features:

- **App Router**: Enhanced routing with better performance
- **Server Components**: Improved server-side rendering
- **TypeScript**: First-class TypeScript support
- **Image Optimization**: Built-in image optimization

## Setting Up the Project

First, let's create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-portfolio --typescript --tailwind --eslint
```

## Key Features We'll Build

1. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
2. **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes
3. **Contact Form**: Integrated with email service
4. **Blog System**: MDX-powered blog
5. **Performance**: Optimized for speed

## Dark Mode Implementation

We'll use React Context to manage theme state:

```tsx
const ThemeContext = createContext<ThemeContextType | undefined>(undefined);
```

## Contact Form with Resend

Integrate email functionality using Resend API:

```tsx
const response = await fetch('/api/send-email', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify(formData),
});
```

## Conclusion

Building a modern portfolio requires attention to detail, performance optimization, and user experience. With Next.js 15 and the right tools, you can create something truly exceptional.
